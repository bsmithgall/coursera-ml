%NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer

%   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
%   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
%   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
%   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
% 
%   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
%   partial derivatives of the neural network.
%

% Reshape nn_params back into the parameters Theta1 and Theta2, the weight matrices
% for our 2 layer neural network
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

% Setup some useful variables
m = size(X, 1);
         
% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
Theta1_grad = zeros(size(Theta1));
Theta2_grad = zeros(size(Theta2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
%
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m

% Implement Part I -- returning the cost variable J

% J(theta) = 1/m * sigma(i=1 to m) of sigma(k=1 to K) of [
%                     -y(i)k * log((h(theta)(x(i))k) -
%                    (1y(i)k) * log(1 - (h(theta)(x(i))k))]
% where h(theta(x(i))k) is the result of the NN forward prop
% and K is the total number of possible layers.

% First initialize X input to include a row of ones

X = [ones(m,1) X];

% Now, implement forward propagation, similar to ex3

z1 = sigmoid(Theta1 * X');
a2 = [ones(1, size(z1, 2)); z1];
a3 = sigmoid(Theta2 * a2);
h = a3;

% Note that this time we do not transpose a3 to create h as to make
% the following matrix multiplication slightly simpler

% Now we tranform the y result vector into a matrix where 1s in the
% columns map to the corresponding values of y

yMatrix = zeros(num_labels, m);

for i=1:num_labels,
    yMatrix(i,:) = (y==i);
endfor

% Now that we have y as a 10x5000 matrix instead of a 5000x1 vector,
% we can use it to calculate our cost as compared to h (which is a3)

% Note that for this vectorized implementation, y(i)k is given as
% yMatrix and h is given as h(thetha)(x(i))k

J = (sum( sum( -1*yMatrix.*log(h) - (1 - yMatrix).*log(1-h) ) ))/m;

% Implementing regularization

% For this we can steal some of the logic from ex2 costFunctionReg.m

% First, we toss the first columns of each Theta(i) matrix.

Theta1Reg = Theta1(:,2:size(Theta1,2));
Theta2Reg = Theta2(:,2:size(Theta2,2));

% Now implement the regularization formula described on page 6 of ex4.

Reg = (lambda/(2*m)) * (sum(sum( Theta1Reg.^2 )) + sum( sum( Theta2Reg.^2 ) ));

% Now just add the regularization term to the previously calculated J

J = J + Reg;

% -------------------------------------------------------------

% Implement Part II -- implementing back propagation
% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
%         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.
%

% We are going to initialize this as a for loop from 1:m

for k = 1:m,
    % First, we do forward propogation on an X that already contains
    % the bias node (from above)

    a1 = X(k,:);
    z2 = Theta1 * a1';

    a2 = sigmoid(z2);
    a2 = [1 ; a2];

    % Now we have our final activation layer a3 == h(theta)
    a3 = sigmoid(Theta2 * a2);

    % Now that we have our activation layer, we go backwards
    % This basically just involves following along the formulas given
    % on Page 9
    d3 = a3 - yMatrix(:,k);
    
    % Re-add a bais node for z2
    z2 = [1 ; z2];
    d2 = (Theta2' * d3) .* sigmoidGradient(z2);
    % Strip out bais node from resulting d2
    d2 = d2(2:end);

    Theta2_grad = (Theta2_grad + d3 * a2');
    Theta1_grad = (Theta1_grad + d2 * a1);

endfor;

% Now divide everything (element-wise) by m to return the partial
% derivatives. Note that for regularization these will have to
% removed/commented out.

% Theta2_grad = Theta2_grad ./ m;
% Theta1_grad = Theta1_grad ./ m;

% -------------------------------------------------------------

% Implement Part III -- Regularization with cost function/gradients
%
% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.
%

% The formula for regularization is given on page 12 and is as
% follows: Delta(l(i,j)) = 1/m*delta(l(i,j)) + lambda/m*(Theta(l(i,j))
% for j >= 1

% Implement for Theta1 and Theta2 when l = 0
Theta1_grad(:,1) = Theta1_grad(:,1)./m;
Theta2_grad(:,1) = Theta2_grad(:,1)./m;

% Implement for Theta1 and Theta 2 when l > 0
Theta1_grad(:,2:end) = Theta1_grad(:,2:end)./m + ( (lambda/m) * Theta1(:,2:end) );
Theta2_grad(:,2:end) = Theta2_grad(:,2:end)./m + ( (lambda/m) * Theta2(:,2:end) );
